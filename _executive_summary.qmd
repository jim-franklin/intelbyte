This document presents the technical design for a Factory Equipment Health and Maintenance Platform developed for Intelbyte. The objective of the platform is to provide clear, real-time visibility into the health and operational status of equipment across multiple manufacturing plants, while preserving a complete historical record of machine telemetry, operator inputs, and maintenance activity for analysis, reporting, and audit purposes.

The proposed solution uses a scalable, event-driven data architecture that separates high-volume telemetry ingestion from day-to-day operational decision-making. Machine sensor readings such as temperature, vibration, throughput, and fault codes are captured as timestamped events for long-term retention, while a derived current equipment state is maintained for each machine. This enables supervisors to view a single, up-to-date record per asset without querying large historical datasets, even as data volumes grow.

The platform supports multiple plants, production lines, and machines, along with operator shift reports, manual inspections, and status overrides. Maintenance requests are generated automatically based on configurable thresholds, fault patterns, and operator-reported issues. A machine health scoring process combines recent telemetry signals and fault history into a single, easy-to-interpret score, while a clear precedence model resolves the current machine status across telemetry, operator inputs, and active work orders.

Overall, the design is practical, transparent, and scalable. It delivers immediate value for day-to-day operations and supports timely maintenance decisions, while leaving room to add features such as predictive maintenance, deeper analysis, and AI based insights as the platform grows.
