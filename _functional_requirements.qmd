These define the essential capabilities the platform provides to support equipment monitoring, maintenance, and operational decision-making. They are organized by functional area for clarity.

### Asset and Equipment Management
- Support multiple plants, production lines, and machines  
- Maintain a clear hierarchical relationship between plants, lines, and machines  

### Telemetry and Data Ingestion
- Ingest continuous machine telemetry, including temperature, vibration, throughput, and fault codes  
- Associate each telemetry record with a machine identifier and timestamp  
- Retain telemetry data as a complete historical record for analysis, reporting, and audits  

### Operator and User Inputs
- Allow operators to log shift reports, inspection results, and issue descriptions  
- Record manual machine status updates with user attribution  
- Store operator comments and inspection notes alongside machine and telemetry data  

### Maintenance Management
- Automatically create maintenance requests based on configurable thresholds, fault patterns, and operator reported issues  
- Track maintenance requests through their lifecycle, including status updates and resolution details  
- Link maintenance history to machines and triggering events  

### Health and Status Monitoring
- Calculate a machine health score using recent telemetry signals and fault history  
- Determine the current machine status by reconciling telemetry data, operator inputs, and active maintenance work orders  
- Provide a Current Equipment Status view showing one row per machine using the most recent available data  

### Reporting and Dashboards
- Provide dashboards for supervisors to monitor equipment health, status, and maintenance activity  
- Support filtering by plant, production line, machine, status, and health indicators
