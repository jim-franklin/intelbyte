Manufacturing environments operate large numbers of machines across multiple plants and production lines, generating continuous streams of sensor data alongside operator reports and inspections. While this information is essential for monitoring equipment condition, its volume and fragmentation make it difficult to use effectively for day-to-day operational decisions.

A central challenge is maintaining a clear, up to date view of current equipment status while preserving complete historical data for analysis, reporting, and audits. Supervisors require a simple snapshot of machine health and status, whereas engineers and analysts need access to detailed historical records to identify trends, recurring issues, and long term performance patterns. Without a unified approach, teams often rely on manual processes, disconnected data sources, and reactive maintenance practices.

The objective of this platform is to address these challenges by providing a unified, scalable foundation for equipment health and maintenance management. At a high level, the platform is designed to:

- Provide a single, reliable view of the current status and health of each machine  
- Ingest and retain high volume telemetry data for long term analysis and audits  
- Capture operator reports, inspections, and status changes alongside sensor data  
- Automatically trigger maintenance requests based on thresholds, fault patterns, and reported issues  
- Support growth across plants, machines, and data volumes without major redesign
