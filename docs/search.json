    "text": "This document presents the technical design for a Factory Equipment Health and Maintenance Platform developed for Intelbyte. The objective of the platform is to provide clear, real-time visibility into the health and operational status of equipment across multiple manufacturing plants, while preserving a complete historical record of machine telemetry, operator inputs, and maintenance activity for analysis, reporting, and audit purposes.\nThe proposed solution uses a scalable, event-driven data architecture that separates high-volume telemetry ingestion from day-to-day operational decision-making. Machine sensor readings such as temperature, vibration, throughput, and fault codes are captured as timestamped events for long-term retention, while a derived current equipment state is maintained for each machine. This enables supervisors to view a single, up-to-date record per asset without querying large historical datasets, even as data volumes grow.\nThe platform supports multiple plants, production lines, and machines, along with operator shift reports, manual inspections, and status overrides. Maintenance requests are generated automatically based on configurable thresholds, fault patterns, and operator-reported issues. A machine health scoring process combines recent telemetry signals and fault history into a single, easy-to-interpret score, while a clear precedence model resolves the current machine status across telemetry, operator inputs, and active work orders.\nOverall, the design is practical, transparent, and scalable. It delivers immediate value for day-to-day operations and supports timely maintenance decisions, while leaving room to add features such as predictive maintenance, deeper analysis, and AI based insights as the platform grows."

    "text": "4.3 Architecture Pattern and Rationale\nThe architecture follows an event-driven pattern with a derived current-state view to handle high-frequency telemetry that grows rapidly over time. Telemetry is stored as immutable events to preserve a complete historical record for analysis and audits, while a separate current equipment state is maintained to support fast operational queries without scanning large historical datasets.\nBy decoupling telemetry ingestion from operational workflows, the system improves scalability and reliability. Telemetry capture can continue even if downstream processing is delayed, and user-facing views can rely on a lightweight current-state store for near real-time visibility. This design also supports incremental evolution, allowing more advanced analytics and predictive maintenance features to be added without restructuring the core architecture."

    "text": "5.1 Data Model Overview\nThe data model is built around three ideas.\nFirst, the platform uses a clear asset hierarchy so machines can always be understood in context. Every machine belongs to a production line, and every production line belongs to a plant. This hierarchy enables filtering, reporting, and access control by site and line.\nSecond, telemetry and events are immutable. Sensor readings and machine signals are written once and never changed. This preserves data integrity and makes the system reliable for trend analysis, root cause investigation, and compliance.\nThird, the system maintains a derived current state for each machine. Instead of recalculating status from millions of telemetry records, the platform keeps one up-to-date row per machine that reflects its latest condition. This is what operational screens and supervisors rely on."
