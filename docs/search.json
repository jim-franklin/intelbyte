    "text": "This document presents the technical design for a Factory Equipment Health and Maintenance Platform developed for Intelbyte. The objective of the platform is to provide clear, real-time visibility into the health and operational status of equipment across multiple manufacturing plants, while preserving a complete historical record of machine telemetry, operator inputs, and maintenance activity for analysis, reporting, and audit purposes.\nThe proposed solution uses a scalable, event-driven data architecture that separates high-volume telemetry ingestion from day-to-day operational decision-making. Machine sensor readings such as temperature, vibration, throughput, and fault codes are captured as timestamped events for long-term retention, while a derived current equipment state is maintained for each machine. This enables supervisors to view a single, up-to-date record per asset without querying large historical datasets, even as data volumes grow.\nThe platform supports multiple plants, production lines, and machines, along with operator shift reports, manual inspections, and status overrides. Maintenance requests are generated automatically based on configurable thresholds, fault patterns, and operator-reported issues. A machine health scoring process combines recent telemetry signals and fault history into a single, easy-to-interpret score, while a clear precedence model resolves the current machine status across telemetry, operator inputs, and active work orders.\nOverall, the design is practical, transparent, and scalable. It delivers immediate value for day-to-day operations and supports timely maintenance decisions, while leaving room to add features such as predictive maintenance, deeper analysis, and AI based insights as the platform grows."

It is expected to scale to thousands of machines generating high-frequency telemetry without requiring major redesign or manual intervention.\nOperational views used by supervisors and maintenance teams must remain highly available and reflect the latest known state of each machine in near real-time. To support audits, investigations, and long-term analysis, all telemetry and operational events are preserved as immutable historical records. The platform enforces role based access control to ensure users can only view or perform actions appropriate to their role, protecting sensitive operational data and workflows.

Telemetry capture can continue even if downstream processing is delayed, and user-facing views can rely on a lightweight current-state store for near real-time visibility. This design also supports incremental evolution, allowing more advanced analytics and predictive maintenance features to be added without restructuring the core architecture."

Every machine belongs to a production line, and every production line belongs to a plant. This hierarchy enables filtering, reporting, and access control by site and line.\nSecond, telemetry and events are immutable. Sensor readings and machine signals are written once and never changed. This preserves data integrity and makes the system reliable for trend analysis, root cause investigation, and compliance.\nThird, the system maintains a derived current state for each machine. Instead of recalculating status from millions of telemetry records, the platform keeps one up-to-date row per machine that reflects its latest condition.

    "section": "6.1 Machine Health Scoring",
    "text": "6.1 Machine Health Scoring\nThe Machine Health Scoring algorithm converts raw machine signals into a single, easy-to-understand indicator that reflects how healthy a machine is at any moment. The goal is not to predict failure perfectly in the MVP, but to provide a clear, consistent signal that helps supervisors and maintenance teams prioritize attention.\nIndustry platforms often normalize machine health to a 0–100 scale to simplify interpretation for operations and maintenance teams Uptime (2022). The score combines three ideas that are common in industrial monitoring systems:\n\nNormal operation keeps the score high\n\nAbnormal sensor readings reduce the score gradually\n\nFaults and maintenance states reduce the score immediately and visibly\n\n\n6.1.1 How often the score is recalculated\nThe health score is recalculated each time new telemetry is processed for a machine, which in typical industrial environments means every few seconds to every minute, depending on sensor. High frequency signals such as temperature or vibration may arrive every 5–30 seconds, while lower frequency metrics such as throughput or energy usage may arrive every 1–5 minutes.\nRather than recomputing the score from all historical data, the system updates the score incrementally using the previous value. This keeps the score near real-time, computationally efficient, and stable for dashboards, while still reacting quickly when sustained issues or faults appear.\n\n\n6.1.2 Where the score is stored\nThe computed score is written to CurrentMachineState.healthScore for each machine:\n\nTable: CurrentMachineState\n\nPrimary key: machineId\n\nForeign keys:\n\nmachineId -&gt; Machine.machineId\n\nlastTelemetryEventId -&gt; TelemetryEvent.telemetryEventId\n\nlastOperatorReportId -&gt; OperatorReport.operatorReportId\n\n\nKey fields updated by this algorithm:\n\nhealthScore\n\nlastUpdateAt\n\n\nThis aligns with Table 1.\n\n\n6.1.3 Scoring logic overview\nAt each update, the score is computed using recent machine behavior, not the full telemetry history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTelemetry Frequency and Rolling Window\n\n\n\nThe machines are assumed to publish telemetry approximately every 30 seconds. A 15 minute rolling window is therefore used for health scoring, providing about 30 samples per metric. This window smooths short-lived sensor noise while remaining responsive to sustained changes in machine condition.\n\n\nThe scoring logic combines:\n\nThe latest telemetry readings, aggregated as rolling averages over a 15 minute window\nCurrent machine status (Running, Idle, Fault, UnderMaintenance)\n\nAny active fault codes and their severity (High, Medium)\n\nOperator flags from inspections (IssueObserved, MinorConcern)\n\nThe annotated pseudocode below shows exactly how each signal contributes to the final score and how the result is stabilized for operational dashboards.\ndef compute_health_score(previous_score):\n1    healthScore = 100\n2    smoothing_param = 0.2\n\n    # sensor penalties\n3    healthScore -= temperature_penalty\n    healthScore -= vibration_penalty\n    healthScore -= throughput_penalty\n\n    # fault severity penalties\n4    if fault_severity == \"High\":\n        healthScore -= 60\n    elif fault_severity == \"Medium\":\n        healthScore -= 30\n\n    # apply operator input only if a report exists\n5    if operator_flag == \"IssueObserved\":\n        healthScore -= 20\n    elif operator_flag == \"MinorConcern\":\n        healthScore -= 10\n\n    # maintenance state cap\n6    if status == \"UnderMaintenance\":\n        healthScore = min(healthScore, 60)\n\n    # smoothing (EWMA)\n7    healthScore = (\n        smoothing_param * healthScore + \n        (1 - smoothing_param) * previous_score\n    )\n\n    # ensure the final score stays between 0 (worst) and 100 (best)\n8    healthScore = max(0, min(100, healthScore))\n    \n    return healthScore\n\n1\n\nStart from a healthy baseline score of 100 for every evaluation.\n\n2\n\nDefine how strongly the new score reacts to recent data versus the previous score.\n\n3\n\nApply penalties based on sensor readings that deviate from normal operating ranges.\n\n4\n\nApply a strong penalty when an active fault is detected, scaled by severity.\n\n5\n\nIncorporate human input from inspections or shift reports when operators flag issues.\n\n6\n\nCap the score when the machine is under maintenance to reflect reduced availability.\n\n7\n\nSmooth the score using an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average to reduce noise.\n\n8\n\nEnsure the final score always remains between 0 and 100."
