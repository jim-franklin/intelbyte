The platform follows an event-driven architecture that separates high-volume telemetry ingestion from operational workflows and user facing views. Machine telemetry is captured as append-only event data to support long-term retention, analysis, and auditability. In parallel, a derived current equipment state is maintained to enable fast operational queries that present one up-to-date record per machine.

At a high level, the system consists of a web application for operators and supervisors, backend services that manage operational workflows and business rules, a telemetry ingestion path optimized for scale, and a database layer that stores both historical telemetry and current machine state. Maintenance requests are generated through configurable rules and recorded as work items linked to the machines and events that triggered them.
