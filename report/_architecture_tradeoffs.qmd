The architecture follows an event-driven pattern with a derived current-state view to handle high-frequency telemetry that grows rapidly over time. Telemetry is stored as immutable events to preserve a complete historical record for analysis and audits, while a separate current equipment state is maintained to support fast operational queries without scanning large historical datasets.

By decoupling telemetry ingestion from operational workflows, the system improves scalability and reliability. Telemetry capture can continue even if downstream processing is delayed, and user-facing views can rely on a lightweight current-state store for near real-time visibility. This design also supports incremental evolution, allowing more advanced analytics and predictive maintenance features to be added without restructuring the core architecture.
