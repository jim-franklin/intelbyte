The platform maintains an operational view of each machine using near real time, event driven processing. As telemetry events arrive, the system updates the current machine state within seconds by resolving machine status and recalculating health indicators. Dashboards query this current state store and refresh on a short interval, providing timely and consistent operational visibility without scanning historical telemetry.
