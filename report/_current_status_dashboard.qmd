The Current Equipment Status screen is the primary operator view. It answers one question quickly: what is happening right now across the line.

**What it shows**

- Fleet level counts by `resolvedStatus` (Running, Idle, Fault, UnderMaintenance)  
- A sortable table of machines with `resolvedStatus`, `healthScore`, `openWorkOrderCount`, and `lastUpdateAt`  
- Quick filters (Plant, Production line, Machine type)
