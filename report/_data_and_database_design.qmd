This section explains how the platform stores, organizes, and serves data in a way that balances **accuracy, scalability, and usability**.  
The design supports both technical needs such as telemetry ingestion and analytics, and business needs such as fast operational views, traceability, and maintainable workflows.

At a high level, the solution separates **historical data** from **operational state**. Telemetry and logs are preserved in full for analysis and audits, while a lightweight current state model ensures that dashboards and user interfaces remain fast and simple.
