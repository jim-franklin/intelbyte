Telemetry and operator inputs follow different paths, but converge in the current equipment state used for operational dashboards.

### Telemetry ingestion flow
1.	Machines or plant gateways send telemetry events to the Telemetry Ingestion API
2.	Events are validated and written to the Telemetry Store as immutable, append-only records
3.	A stream processor consumes telemetry events and updates the Current State Store for the affected machine
4.	The Health Scoring Service recalculates machine health scores based on new data or on a defined schedule
5.	The Rule Engine evaluates thresholds and fault patterns and creates maintenance requests when conditions are met

### Operator input flow
1.	Operators submit shift logs, inspections, comments, or manual status updates through the web application
2.	The Operational API records these inputs in the Operational Store with user attribution
3.	Inputs that affect machine status are reflected in the Current State Store
4.	Operator-reported issues may directly trigger maintenance requests or contribute to rule evaluation

### Operational dashboard flow
- The Current Equipment Status screen queries the Current State Store to retrieve one row per machine for fast operational monitoring.
- Historical analysis and audits query the Telemetry Store and join with operational data as needed for reporting and compliance.
