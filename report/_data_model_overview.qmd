The data model is built around three ideas.

First, the platform uses a clear **asset hierarchy** so machines can always be understood in context. Every machine belongs to a production line, and every production line belongs to a plant. This hierarchy enables filtering, reporting, and access control by site and line.

Second, **telemetry and events are immutable**. Sensor readings and machine signals are written once and never changed. This preserves data integrity and makes the system reliable for trend analysis, root cause investigation, and compliance.

Third, the system maintains a **derived current state** for each machine. Instead of recalculating status from millions of telemetry records, the platform keeps one up-to-date row per machine that reflects its latest condition. This is what operational screens and supervisors rely on.
