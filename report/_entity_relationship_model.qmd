The Entity Relationship Diagram below shows the core entities and how they connect. It is intentionally kept high level so it remains readable for both technical and non-technical readers. See @tbl-field-level-details for field level details.

This model shows how physical assets, telemetry, human inputs, and maintenance workflows are connected while keeping responsibilities clearly separated.
