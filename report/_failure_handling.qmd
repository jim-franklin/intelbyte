The system is designed to remain operational under common failure scenarios:

-   Telemetry spikes or bursts: Event buffering absorbs temporary surges without dropping data.  
-   Temporary processing delays: If downstream services slow down, telemetry ingestion continues and processing resumes when capacity is available.  
-	Service restarts or redeployments: Stateless processing components can restart safely, using stored state and telemetry history to resume operation.  
-	Partial data loss or gaps: Rolling windows and incremental scoring ensure that short interruptions do not permanently distort machine health indicators.
