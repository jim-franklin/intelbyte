As the platform evolves beyond the MVP, the following enhancements can be considered:

-   Introduce predictive maintenance models using historical telemetry and work order outcomes  
-	Refine health scoring using machine-type-specific models and adaptive thresholds  
- 	Add automated anomaly detection to complement rule-based logic  
-	Enhance dashboards with trend views and cross-plant comparisons  

Overall, the architecture provides a solid foundation that balances simplicity for the MVP with a clear path toward more advanced industrial analytics and automation.
