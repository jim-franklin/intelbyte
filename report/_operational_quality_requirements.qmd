Beyond core functionality, the platform is designed to operate reliably in a production environment where data volume and operational complexity increase over time. It is expected to scale to thousands of machines generating high-frequency telemetry without requiring major redesign or manual intervention.

Operational views used by supervisors and maintenance teams must remain highly available and reflect the latest known state of each machine in near real-time. To support audits, investigations, and long-term analysis, all telemetry and operational events are preserved as immutable historical records. The platform enforces role based access control to ensure users can only view or perform actions appropriate to their role, protecting sensitive operational data and workflows. System components are loosely coupled so ingestion, processing, analytics, and user facing features can be updated or extended independently, supporting continuous improvement without disrupting ongoing operations.
