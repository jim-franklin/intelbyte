The primary security concerns addressed by the platform include:

-   Unauthorized access to operational data, such as machine health, fault history, and maintenance records  
-   Improper modification of machine state, which could lead to unsafe operational decisions  
-   Loss of traceability, where it becomes unclear who changed a status or triggered maintenance  
-   Exposure of sensitive telemetry or operational metadata across plants and regions  

The architecture mitigates these risks by separating ingestion, processing, and presentation layers, and by enforcing access controls at every boundary.
