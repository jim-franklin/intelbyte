This report presents a scalable and practical approach to building a Factory Equipment Health and Maintenance Platform MVP. By separating telemetry ingestion, state resolution, health scoring, and visualization, the platform achieves clarity, performance, and operational reliability.

Key strengths of the proposed solution include:

-	A clear and explainable machine status model with explicit precedence rules  
-	Near real-time operational visibility without querying historical telemetry  
-	Independent and incremental health scoring suitable for streaming data  
-	Strong foundations for security, auditability, and role-based access
