Telemetry data is modeled as an immutable event stream. Each new reading is inserted and never updated. This guarantees a complete and trustworthy history that can support audits, analytics, and future use cases without redesign.

Operational views do not query this history directly. Instead, the `CurrentMachineState` table is continuously updated as telemetry arrives, operator reports are submitted, and work orders change status. Each row represents the latest resolved view of a machine, including status, health score, and maintenance indicators.

This separation between append only history and derived operational state is the key scaling decision in the design. It keeps dashboards fast and predictable while preserving full historical detail for deeper analysis and long-term insight.
