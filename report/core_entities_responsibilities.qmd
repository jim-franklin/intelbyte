The platform relies on a small but complete set of entities.

- Plants, production lines, machines, and machine types define the physical structure of the factory.
- Telemetry events capture raw machine signals over time.
- Operator reports capture human observations, inspections, and manual overrides.
- Work orders represent maintenance actions from creation through closure.
- Fault codes and threshold rules standardize how issues are detected and interpreted.
- Current machine state provides a fast operational snapshot for each machine.

Together, these entities allow the system to explain ***what happened***, ***why it happened***, and ***what action*** was taken.
