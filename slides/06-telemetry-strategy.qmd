## Telemetry and Current State Strategy

To balance scalability with real-time operational visibility, the platform decouples how data is **stored** from how it is **served to users**:

- Telemetry events are stored as an append-only history for analytics, audits, and reporting
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-up}
- A separate `CurrentMachineState` table maintains one row per machine for operational views
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-up}
- Status and health are updated through event-driven upserts as telemetry and operational events arrive

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
- Dashboards read exclusively from `CurrentMachineState` for fast, predictable performance
