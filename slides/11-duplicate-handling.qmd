## Handling Duplicate Events and Work Orders

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
-	Telemetry events, rule evaluations, and retries can surface the same underlying issue multiple times
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-up}
-	Each issue is assigned a stable **issue key** derived from the **machine** and **problem type**
    - `issueKey`:  hash(`machineId` + `issueType`) = `42_HighTemp`
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-up}
-	The rule engine checks for an existing open work order associated with the same `issueKey`
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-up}
-	If an open work order already exists, the system suppresses creation of a duplicate
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-up}
-	Only transitions (new issue detected or issue resolved) trigger work order changes
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-up}
-	This approach ensures consistent work order counts and reliable status signals, even under delayed or out-of-order events
:::

::: notes
We deduplicate at the issue level, not the event level, which keeps the system stable under real-world delays
