## Security and Data Protection

::: incremental
- Protect operational data and machine state integrity across plants
-	Prevent unauthorized access to machine health, telemetry, and maintenance records
-	Ensure machine status and maintenance actions cannot be modified improperly
-	Preserve clear traceability of who changed status or triggered maintenance
-	Prevent data exposure across plants and regions

::: notes
- Protect operational data and machine state integrity across plants
ensures that machine status, health scores, and maintenance signals are accurate, uncorrupted and trustworthy across all plants, since operators and supervisors rely on this data for safety and production decisions.

- Prevent unauthorized access to machine health, telemetry, and maintenance records
ensures that only authenticated and authorized users are able to view or interact with operational data, preventing accidental exposure or malicious access to sensitive plant information.

- Ensure machine status and maintenance actions cannot be modified improperly
Status changes, overrides, and work order updates must follow controlled workflows, reducing the risk of unsafe decisions caused by unauthorized or accidental edits.

- Preserve clear traceability of who changed status or triggered maintenance
Every status override and work order action is traceable to a user or system component, supporting accountability, troubleshooting, and audit requirements.

- Prevent data exposure across plants and regions
The platform enforces data isolation so users only access data for plants and regions they are authorized to manage, which is important for operational separation and compliance.
