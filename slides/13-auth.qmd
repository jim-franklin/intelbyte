  Role based access control governs what users can see and do
  - Operator, Supervisor, Maintenance, Administrator
:::

::: notes
- Authentication is handled centrally using `Microsoft Entra ID`, which provides a single trusted identity system across the platform.
This allows users to sign in once and access all authorized services securely.

- Single sign on improves usability, while multi factor authentication adds protection for sensitive operational systems.
Managed identities are used for service to service communication without exposing credentials.

- Authorization is enforced through role based access control, ensuring users can only perform actions appropriate to their role.

- Operators can view machine status and submit reports, supervisors can review health and prioritize work, maintenance teams manage work orders, and administrators control users and configuration.
