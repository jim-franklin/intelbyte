## Scalability and Reliability {#scale}

::: incremental
-	**Scalability**: All machine telemetry is written to an append-only event store designed for very high write volume
-	**Operational Performance**: A lightweight `CurrentMachineState` table keeps exactly one row per machine, enabling fast and predictable dashboard queries
-	**Reliability**: Automatically handles failures and duplicate events so machine status remains accurate and consistent
-	**Data Freshness and Trust**: A `lastUpdateAt` timestamp makes it easy to detect stale machines, delayed telemetry, or processing gaps
:::

::: notes
-	Start by reminding them that industrial systems generate a lot of data very quickly
-	The append-only telemetry store absorbs this volume without slowing down the system
-	Instead of querying history, dashboards read from a small current-state table optimized for operations
-	Event-driven updates mean the system reacts immediately as data arrives
-	Idempotent upserts ensure retries or duplicates never corrupt machine state
-	`lastUpdateAt` gives operations teams confidence that what they see is current and reliable
-	Overall, this design scales cleanly as plants, machines, and telemetry grow
